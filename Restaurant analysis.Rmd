 Overall income of 145 centers is 654277.89 and the weekly income variance between 7613 and 1403 .

There are 51 types of dishes and their income to the company range between 3193.7 and 31373 .
#How stable is the weekly chick out price ?

#Which restaurant center is more popular by the number of orders?

```{r}

  theme_bw() +

max(centerID$numOrders)

min(centerID$numOrders)


```
There is high difference between the number of orders between the centers.

#How does the centerID influence the number of orders ?
```{r}

lm_food <- lm(checkout_price ~ center_id, data = food)
summary(lm_food)
coef(lm_food)
anova(lm_food)
```

#How is the weekly orders of one center ?
```{r}

centerIncome10 <- food %>% 
  group_by(week) %>% 
  filter(center_id == 10) %>% 
  summarise(num_orders)  

ggplot(centerIncome10, aes(week, num_orders))+
  geom_point(color = plasma(30)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se =FALSE, color = 'black') +

       x ="Week",

  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "non")


mean(centerIncome10$num_orders)

#Variance
sd(centerIncome10$num_orders)
```
In this center the liner is going up by variation of 599.

#another center
```{r}

centerIncome23 <- food %>% 
  group_by(week) %>% 
  filter(center_id == 23) %>% 
  summarise(num_orders)

ggplot(centerIncome23, aes(week, num_orders))+
  geom_point(color = plasma(31)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se =FALSE, color = 'black') + 
  labs(title = "Number of Oreders of One Center",
       x ="Week",
       y = "Number of orders")+
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "non")

mean(centerIncome23$num_orders)

#Variance
sd(centerIncome23$num_orders)

```

#all centers
```{r}

centerIncomeAll <- food %>% 
  group_by(week) %>%
  filter(num_orders < 1000) %>% 
  summarise(allOrders = sum(num_orders))

ggplot(centerIncomeAll, aes(week, allOrders))+
  geom_point(color = plasma(145)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se =FALSE, color = 'black') + 
  labs(title = "Number of Oreders of All Center",
       x ="Week",
       y = "Number of orders")+
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "non")
  
mean(centerIncomeAll$num_orders)

#Variance 

sd(centerIncomeAll$allOrders)
```
We noticed that the orders are going slightly up in general through the time with variation of 1010.7
